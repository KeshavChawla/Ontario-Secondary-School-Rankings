# Ontario Secondary School Rankings
## Comparing Ontario Secondary School Academic Rankings from the Fraser Institute with Waterloo Engineering Adjustment Factors  

The shown data is a computation of both [Fraser Institute's Secondary School Data](http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/secondary/SchoolsByRankLocationName.aspx) as well as the [University of Waterloo's Engineering Adjustment Factor](https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/).

The Fraser Institute's data relies on objective public metrics including factors the average level of achievement on the grade-9
EQAO assessment in academic and applied mathematics,<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> percentages of Ontario Secondary School Literacy Tests (OSSLT) written by first time and previously eligible students which were successful and unsuccessful,<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> and differences between male and female students in attempts of the OSSLT as well as the grade 9 EQAO assessment.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>


Waterloo Engineering's Adjustment Factor is a list of "what school inflated its marks by how much, by comparing the final high school marks students were admitted with to the marks at the end of first year [university]. For schools whose graduates were admitted often enough to reach conclusions, that information could be used to help make future admissions decisions."<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>

Both datasets are computed equally to provide a more accurate valuation of each secondary school.
