# Ontario Secondary School Rankings
## Comparing Ontario Secondary School Academic Ranking from the Fraser Institute with Waterloo Engineering Adjustment Factors  

The shown data is a computation of both [Fraser Institute's Secondary School Data](http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/secondary/SchoolsByRankLocationName.aspx) as well as the [University of Waterloo's Engineering Adjustment Factor](https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/).

 The Fraser Institute's data relies of objective public metrics including factors the average level of achievement on the grade-9
EQAO assessment in academic and applied mathematics [^1], percentages of Ontario Secondary School Literacy Tests (OSSLT) written by first time and previously eligible students which were successful and unsuccessful[^fn1], and differences between male and female students in attempts of the OSSLT as well as the grade 9 EQAO assessment[^fn2].

Both datasets are computed equally to provide a more accurate valuation of each secondary school.
